# Website-with-Parallax
Author - Ankit Chaturvedi
<br>
This Parallax website is an amazing example of a combined result of html and css.
<br>
I have used properties of CSS like background-attachment and transform-style to give my website a 3-D experience and create a parallax effect.
<br>
Parallax effect is an effect where the background image and main image moves with a different speed.
